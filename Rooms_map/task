A map.xml file is an xml document containing a representation if a linked series of rooms,
each of which may contain an object.

For each room the values of the attributes North, East, South and West
are the IDs of the room you find by moving in each one of those firections.

For example above room 1 is connected with room 2 with a door on its East wall.
A goal file is a plain text document containing, on first line, a string room name,
and the name of a sought object on every following line.

Write a command-line tool which accepts a map.xml file and goal file
and outputs a route from the starting room that allows you to pick up all the sought objects, in the following format,
including any unspecified objects that you happen to pick up along the way:

east

rubber chicken
south
pulley (1/2)
north
